# Packet Capture and Analysis

## Overview
This project demonstrates the use of Wireshark to capture and analyze network traffic, identify protocols, and detect anomalies.

## Tools Used
- [Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/)

## Steps
1. Installed and configured Wireshark.
2. Captured network traffic using filters for HTTP and DNS.
3. Analyzed the traffic to identify communication patterns and anomalies.

## Screenshots

## Lessons Learned
- Gained experience in capturing and filtering network traffic.
- Learned to analyze protocols like HTTP and DNS.
- Identified anomalies and patterns in network activity.

## Next Steps
- Expand analysis to include encrypted traffic (HTTPS).
- Automate packet analysis using command-line tools like `tshark`.
